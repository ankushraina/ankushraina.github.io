<h1>Unit Conversions</h1>
<i>By Ankush Raina, <a href="mailto:ankushraina.com@gmail.com">ankushraina.com@gmail.com</a></i>
<h2>A Calories Intake App</h2>
<p>
	It all started out with a quest to figure out how many calories I consumed over a period of time.
	In order to do so I needed to know what I ate, how much I ate and how many calories does it have per unit.
	Calories information also known as food label is usually written on food packaging.
	If this is missing, a simple internet search will reveal it.
</p>
<p>
	While I was building this application I encountered many interesting challenges.
	This post talks about one specific problem that naturally arises when converting one unit to another.
</p>

<h2>App Features</h2>
<p>
	The app allowed me to store my own custom units.
	This helped in ease of entering information to app.
	For example my cup was 150ml. I could say I drank 1 cup of coffee instead of saying 150ml of coffee every time.
</p>
<p>
	The app represented food label in its original units.
	This helped to validate food label in case information was entered incorrectly.
	Food labels can have different units and this depends on its serving size or country of origin.
	So the app ended up in various units.
</p>
<p>
	To get calories consumed, the app had to compute a <i>conversion factor</i>.
	This factor when multipled to consumed quantity yielded calories.
	The app may not have information necessary to obtain this.
	In such cases it asked for a basic conversion rule which would help it to compute the factor.
	The app persisted this rule to avoid asking it again in future.
</p>

<h2>Conversion Factor Storage</h2>
<p>
	Let's say there are n units.
	Then there are <code><sup>n</sup>C<sub>2</sub> = n&times;(n-1)&divide;2 = O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code> conversion factors.
	This acts as upper bound of storage.
	For example with 3 units say a, b, c, one can have 6 conversion factors.
	The conversion factor from unit a to unit b is inverse of conversion factor from unit b to unit a.
	Let <code>f<sub>ab</sub></code> denotes conversion factor from unit a to unit b.
	Then <code>f<sub>ab</sub> = 1 &divide; f<sub>ba</sub></code>.
	This fact allowed app to cut down its storage by half.
</p>
<p>
	Let's say we have factor from a to b and b to c.
	We can find out conversion factor from a to c by multiplying these two factors.
	That is <code>f<sub>ac</sub> = f<sub>ab</sub> &times; f<sub>bc</sub></code>.
	For n units one needs at maximum of n - 1 conversion factors.
	This is an important idea.
	This fact allowed app to cut down its storage from quadratic to linear size.
	This is also the lower bound on storage.
</p>

<h2>Computing Conversion Factor</h2>
<p>
	Consider this example
	<ul>
		<li>1 kilogram is 1000 gram</li>
		<li>1 pound is 453.6 gram</li>
		<li>1 gallon is 128 fluid ounce</li>
		<li>1 fluid ounce is 2 tablespoon</li>
	</ul>
	The ask is to find
	<ul>
		<li>1 kilogram is x pounds</li>
		<li>1 gram is y tablespoon</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<figure>
	<img src="images/conversions.svg"/>
	<figcaption>Conversion puzzle, find x and y</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	To solve for x, convert kilograms to grams, 
	and then multiply it with inverse of pound to gram.
</p>
<p>
	To solve for y, note there are two types of units.
	Let's call them as weight units and volume units.
	Weight units consists of kilogram, pound and gram.
	Volume units consists of gallon, fluid ounce and tablespoon.
	There is no conversion factor which can convert weight units to volume units.
	This conversion becomes possible if food density information is available.
	But then different food have different density, so no universal rule exists.
	Therefore y can not be solved.
</p>

<p>
	Let's analyze above method of finding x and y.
	I can solve x because a <i>path</i> exists between <i>source</i> unit kilogram and <i>target</i> unit pound.
	I can not solve y because no such path exists between gram and tablespoon.
	Therefore to solve this problem in general, all I have to do is to find a path between source and target.
	Once path is known, the answer is simply the product of all the conversion factors in that path.
</p>

<h2>Finding The Path</h2>
<p>
	Start with source unit and put it in a <i>list</i> of units to explore.
	At this point I have only one unit in this list.
	Take out one unit from this list.
	If this unit is target unit, I have found the path and I am done.
	Otherwise mark the fact that I'm going to explore this unit.
	Exploration consists of finding all the units that have a known conversion factor with this unit and are not marked.
	Add these new unmarked units to the list.
	Repeat the process of taking out units from the list until we have found the target unit or the list is empty.
	If list is empty and target is not found, then no such path exists.
</p>
<p>
	For those who know <i>graph theory</i> this is a <i>graph traversal algorithm</i>.
	If list is <i>queue</i>, it is called <i>breadth first search</i>.
	If list is <i>stack</i>, it is called <i>depth first search</i>.
</p>

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>
This is a standalone ruby code, implementing above idea.
<pre>
# given input
facts = [
  {from: 'kilogram', to: 'gram', factor: 1000},
  {from: 'pound', to: 'gram', factor: 453.6},
  {from: 'gallon', to: 'fluid ounce', factor: 128},
  {from: 'fluid ounce', to: 'tablespoon', factor: 2}
]

def get_conversion_factor(facts, q)
  # Build adjacency list connecting units with each other using facts
  adj_list = Hash.new {|h,k| h[k] = []} # empty array as default
  facts.each do |r|
    adj_list[r[:from]] << {to: r[:to],   factor: r[:factor]}
    adj_list[r[:to]]   << {to: r[:from], factor: 1.0/r[:factor]}
  end

  # Represents factor to current unit from source.
  # Also acts as way to mark a unit reachable from source.
  factor = {} 
  factor[q[:from]] = 1 # from source to source factor is 1
  list = [q[:from]]

  # The main search loop using list
  while v = list.shift and v != q[:to] # v is nil for empty list
    adj_list[v].each do |e|
      # If already explored skip it
      unless factor[e[:to]]
        factor[e[:to]] = factor[v]*e[:factor]
        list << e[:to] # add to list to explore
      end
    end
  end
  return factor[q[:to]] # nil in case no factor found
end

puts get_conversion_factor facts, {from: 'kilogram', to: 'pound'}
# 2.204585537918871
puts get_conversion_factor facts, {from: 'gram', to: 'tablespoon'}
# nil
